The average radius of gyration for 42 IDPs in comparison with the previous model (HPS-Urry) without angle and dihedral angle potentials.
Gromacs (gmx polystat) has been used to calculate the radius of gyration of IDPs.
The difference between the Rg distributions from two models calculated using scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon and scipy.special.rel_entr packages.
