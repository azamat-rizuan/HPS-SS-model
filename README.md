## Source codes:

CG simulations were performed using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations package (Oct 2020 version), in which HPS-SS codes have been implemented. To run these codes successfully one would require LAMMPS Oct 2020 package installed with the files within LAMMPS_subroutines.


### Input parameters of the HPS-SS model:
* Aminoacid hydropathy scale (aminoacids_hydropathy.dat)
* Van der Waals diameter of aminoacids (aminoacids_vdwdiameter.dat)
* Dihedral angle parameters (**eps_d**) for (i,i+2)  and (i,i+4) rules (eps_d_i+1_i+2.txt, eps_d_i_i+4.txt)


## 1. CÎ±-based helix assignment rules

Helix fraction script (HelixFracDihed15.f90) is used to test different helix assignment rules

The script requires xtc library to compile:
```
ifort -o gethelixfrac HelixFracDihed15.f90 -lxdrf -L/xtc
```

#### To run the script:

for (i,i+2) rule:
```
./gethelixfrac -x traj.xtc -o helix.dat -dihed 0.25 1.3 -assign 0110 -nn 1 -block 5 -eq 1000
```
for (i,i+4) rule:
```
./gethelixfrac -x traj.xtc -o helix.dat -dihed 0.25 1.7 -assign 0110 -nn 3 010 -block 5 -eq 1000
```
 The output is then compared with the DSSP-based helix fraction of Ala40 peptide from atomistic simulation (AA-A40 folder)

## 2. Parameterization

* A40 simulations with different **eps_d** values to figure out the reference value for highest helicity to match the experimental helical propensity for Alanine. The example is given in /parameterization/ala_40/

* Helix propensity code (HelixPropensity.f90) was used to compute helix propensity (w) directly from the simulation trajectory. To compile: 
```
ifort -o gethelixprop HelixPropensity.f90 -lxdrf -L/xtc
```
to run: 

for (i,i+2) rule:
```
./gethelixprop -x alanine.xtc -p alanine.pdb -o helicity_ala.dat -dihed 0.25 1.3 -assign 0110 -nn 1 010 -block 5 -eq 100000 -nmc 100000 -seed 1234567
```
for (i,i+4) rule:
```
./gethelixprop -x alanine.xtc -p alanine.pdb -o helicity_ala.dat -dihed 0.25 1.7 -assign 0110 -nn 3 010 -block 5 -eq 100000 -nmc 100000 -seed 1234567
```

* **eps_d** for remaining 19 residues determined using a host-guest system such as A20XA20 or A20X4A20
The example is given in parameterization/A20XA20_example/ directory

## 3. Validation (check /examples/ctd/ directory)

* TDP-43 CTD files was added as an example for the validation step
*  Simulated helix fraction was calculated from TDP-43 CTD single chain simulation trajectory using the parameters for (i,i+4) rule
* From the available NMR data from BMRM database, a single residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score is calculated based on the deviations of NMR chemical shifts from Poulsen IDP/IUP random coil chemical shifts.
